# Project

The **SALTO** project is one of the University of Turinâ€™s initiatives in the field of **Public Engagement**.
It was selected as a winner of the 2023 [University of Turin Public Engagement funding call](https://www.unito.it/territorio-e-societa/condivisione-e-partecipazione/progetti-di-public-engagement-di-ateneo).

## Objectives

The project seeks to identify the actual needs related to **health and well-being**, reduce barriers to accessing **local healthcare services**, and offer clear,
multilingual information on **safe medication use** and **daily practices that support personal well-being**.

More specifically, its goals are to:

- Identify real needs concerning health and well-being
- Foster dialogue and active participation
- Share accessible and reliable information
- Improve access to healthcare services
- Provide training for healthcare providers

## Activities

The SALTO project is primarily aimed at **foreign residents living in the municipality of Turin**, with a particular focus on districts **5, 6, 7, and 8**.
Special attention will be given to **women and mothers**, not only because some of the project's thematic areas specifically address their needs,
but also because they often play a central role as **caregivers responsible for the health and well-being of their families**.

In terms of nationality, the project will focus on the **most represented communities** in these districts, especially those facing greater linguistic and cultural barriers.

Thanks to the materials and resources developed, foreign citizens involved in the project will be better equipped
to **access local healthcare services**, **adopt healthier daily habits**, and **prevent illness**, ultimately supporting both **physical and mental well-being**.

The project will also benefit a number of **health and education professionals**, including **volunteers, teachers, and coordinators from partner organizations such as CPIA 1 and 2**,
as well as **pharmacists** working in the targeted districts. These professionals will receive **tools and strategies** to help them communicate and interact more effectively with foreign users.

In addition, **medical professionals**, particularly **dermatologists**
participating in the Continuing Medical Education (CME) sessions, will have the opportunity to explore the project's topics in greater depth.

Sure! Here's the rephrased version of your text in Markdown format:

University students involved in the project through dedicated educational activities will benefit from both **cultural enrichment** and
the opportunity to **earn academic credits** to support their studies.

SALTO aims to reach a **significant portion of the population residing in Turin**, generating **positive and tangible outcomes** not only for
foreign citizens. By **simplifying access to information and services related to health and well-being**, the project aspires to take an important step toward
**fostering inclusion and improving quality of life for everyone**.
